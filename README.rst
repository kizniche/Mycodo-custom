About
=====

These are custom Inputs and custom Controllers created for `Mycodo <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo>`__ that don't quite fit with the built-in set. This could be for a number of reasons (they're experimental/unreliable, they will be rarely used, they're too complex for the average user, etc). As such, I've created this repository to share them publicly in case anyone wants to use them.

Blog Post: `Remote Radiation Monitoring <https://kylegabriel.com/projects/2019/08/remote-radiation-monitoring.html>`__

Details and code: `Mycodo-custom/custom_inputs/geiger counter/ <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo-custom/blob/master/custom_inputs/geiger%20counter>`__

This Input was designed for use with the Moteino Mega with a LoRaWAN transceiver, connected to a MightyOhm Geiger Counter (v1.0), powered by three AA batteries, for long-term remote radiation monitoring.

Custom Controllers
==================

CoolBot Clone
-------------

By `Kyle Gabriel <https://kylegabriel.com/>`__

Details and code: `Mycodo-custom/custom_controllers/coolbot clone/ <https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo-custom/blob/master/custom_controllers/coolbot%20clone>`__

This Controller mimics the functionality of a `CoolBot <https://storeitcold.com>`__, allowing a walking cool room or freezer to be created using an inexpensive air conditioner unit.
