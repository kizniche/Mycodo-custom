# Mycodo Custom Inputs

These are custom Inputs I created for [Mycodo](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo) that don't quite fit with the built-in set. This could be for a number of reasons (they're experimental/unreliable, they will be rarely used, they're too complex for the average user, etc). As such, I've created this repository to share them publicly in case anyone wants to use them.

Details and code: [Mycodo-custom-inputs/geiger_counter/](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo-custom-inputs/tree/master/geiger%20counter)

This Input was designed for use with the Moteino Mega with a LoRaWAN transceiver, connected to a MightyOhm Geiger Counter (v1.0), powered by three AAA batteries, for long-term remote radiation monitoring.
